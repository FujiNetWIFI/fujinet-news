' wrap.bas -- greedy whole-word wrap for headline/title text.
'
' The news server pre-wraps article BODIES to ps=20x8, but article-list
' headlines and the reader title arrive as one long field -- wrapping them
' client-side (whole words moved to the next line, never split mid-word)
' is what this provides.
'
' Contract:
'   #w_src  IN/OUT: address of a NUL-terminated, already-sanitized field.
'           On return it points at that field's NUL (callers advance past
'           it with #w_src + 1).
'   #w_dst  IN: destination base. Output is w_rows rows of stride 21 --
'           up to 20 characters + NUL each, ready for scr_puts (s_max=20).
'   w_rows  IN: row budget (3 for headlines, 2 for the reader title).
' Text beyond the budget is dropped and the last row ellipsized ("...").
' Unused rows get a NUL at offset 0 so stale buffer content never shows.
' Words longer than 20 characters (rare: URLs) are hard-split at column 20.
